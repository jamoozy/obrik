# What is Obrik?
This project's goal is to make an interactive free body diagram simulator. The idea is that you draw in a free body diagram (using a mouse on a normal PC or a stylus on a tablet) and hit the "play" button to watch the thing be simulated.

# Motivation
This was inspired by ASSIST ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZNTgglPbUA)): A Shrewd Sketch Interpretation and Simulation Tool, designed by MIT's then-named [Design Rationale Group](http://rationale.csail.mit.edu) (currently [Multimodal Understanding Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mug)).

# Similar software
This section lists similar software and how it is different from Obrik (Though Obrik is not yet complete).  If you know of more, email me with a link.

## ASSIST
[ASSIST](http://rationale.csail.mit.edu/project_assist_a_shrewd_sketch_interpretation.html) is not fully [free software](http://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) because of a dependency on a proprietary physics engine. Also, you can't get your hands on a copy without emailing the guy in the youtube video a million times. Even if he does send it to you, it's so outdated it doesn't work any more (I know, I've tried.)

## Algodoo
[Algodoo](http://www.algodoo.com/) (formerly "Phun") has no sketch interface. Much of the appeal of using ASSIST came from being able to draw almost anything in the free body diagram domain and have it work for you. Phun is very functional (I think they even use Box2D, like Obrik), but you are constrained by the pre-widgetted UI.

## Crayon Physics
[Crayon Physics](http://www.crayonphysics.com/) is a proprietary physics simulator that lets you draw objects and watch them simulate.  It's very functional and fun, though it doesn't simulate free body diagrams; the things you can draw are very constrained.
